      <h2>Nilio</h2>
      <h3>Light that changes color very slowly</h3>

      <p>
       I created Nilio after being inspired by two other installations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first, in Brown's Granoff building, is called "2*5". It was created by the architecture firm Diller Scofidio Renfro. 2*5 changes color and pattern approximately once a day. While I was in college, each day I walked past 2*5 and saw a new combination of colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to create a light that would change slightly every day. Just like 2*5, I wanted to be suprised every morning with something which was mostly familar, but a little bit brand new.
      </p>

      <p>
         My second piece of inspiration for Nieleo was a pot that I built a while ago. The pot fit snuggly into my old office floor at IBM. I built a custom in-floor drainage system for it and planted a Peace Lilly. That pot was awesome. When my team moved out of the old office, I knew I wanted to create something new with the pot's wooden pieces.

      <p>
        I started by expoloring different forms.
      </p>
      <img src='../assets/nileo/ledlightseries.jpg'>
      <p>
        The big breakthrough on form came when I realized that three pieces of wood would look more elegant than four. Three piece wooden forms would also be simpler to wire with LEDs. I played around with some rotations of my favorite shape, mentally ignoring the fourth piece of wood:
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I wrote some arduino code to control the LED lights.
      </p>
      <p>
        The light would have five possible colors. Each day, one of the colors would be randomly selected, changed slightly, and displayed. This results in a familar yet evolving pattern of lights. Noticable changes to each of the five colors occur over the course of months.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, I assembled the finished product.

      <p>
        My girlfriend thought that the light looked kind of like an Ikea product, so we named it Nilio.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, I would like to integrate Nilio with Alexa and Google Home, so that the light blinks when a timer goes off, displays the weather, and responds to music.
