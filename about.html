          <p>Hi!</p>
          <p>My name is Ben. Here's my <a>resume</a> and <a>LinkedIn</a>. I spend my time collaboratively creating.  I seek out projects at the intersection of imaginative thinking and practical application. </p>
          <p>Most of my work experience has been on software product teams. But I’ve also designed and built a small house, crafted business proposals, and delivered user experiences that blend physical and digital spaces (sometimes leveraging AR or VR). </p>
          <p>I’m a jack of many trades. On product teams, I often fall into an underserved role that helps accelerate outcomes. I’m comfortable working as a <span>project manager</span>,<span> user researcher</span>, <span> full-stack developer</span>, or <span> data scientist</span>. I have some pretty strong opinions on quantitative user research, a topic that draws on (and has helped me to develop) all four of those skill sets. It is absolutely fascinating to study and optimize the process through which teams collectively identify and solve their user's problems! Usually my team’s needs, and my deliverables, evolve throughout the product lifecycle (generative research &#8594 iterative prototyping &#8594 continuous deliverly). </p>
          <p> I’ve spent the last few years at IBM Design, creating new products for data storage and analytics. Before that, I studied CS and interactive multimedia at Brown University. My interests include machine learning, the 4th Industrial Revolution, writing, architecture, and sound. </p>

            <p>I saw a lantern </p>
            <p>Five feet in air </p>
            <p>Light in the night </p>
            <p>Hovering there </p>
            <br>
            <p class='mobile-clear'>The realists are all boring </p>
            <p>The dreamers leave me snoring </p>
            <p>They’re grounded so shamelessly </p>
            <p>Or float away aimlessly </p>
            <br>
            <p>But when your eyes reflect the moon </p>
            <p>You light the sky with shades of blue </p>
            <p>Samantha, blue lantern, will you be mine? </p>
            <p>I’m the realest one who, like you, </p>
            <p>Still knows how to fly</p>
