  	  	<p>
	        The idea behind The Last Stand was to create a video game controlled by rolling around in office chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a wall outside of the game space, a projected video showed an army officer who warned of an alien invasion. Two participants at a time entered the game space and sat down in office chairs. A screen mounted above the heads of participants showed alien ships attacking. By rolling to the position of the aliens and pulling a trigger, participants were able to shoot down the invaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Implementing this project involved acting, video editing, and substantial networking and real-time signal processing tasks. The video game and supporting software elements were written in Processing and Max/MSP (as well as Jitter).
        </p>
        <p> 
          The Last Stand exists somewhere on the continuum between installation art and video game. It was created by Pierce Shipp, Adam Green, and myself for exhibition in the Granoff Arts Center.
