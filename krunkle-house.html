          Krunkle House is a 628 sq ft one bedroom home. It was collaboratively designed and built by five other students, myself, and three instructors during the 2012 UMass/Yestermorrow Semester in Sustainable Design/Build. Krunkle house has three cantilevers, two exposed ibeams, and one sailboat restoration studio (located in the building's basement).

          I worked with and learned from some amazing teachers (and from a very passionate group of fellow students). Additionally, I had the opportunity to see some of my own ideas come to life. In the words of program director Jose Galarza, "Ben was responsible for generating the guiding spatial logic of the building."

          Jennifer Cavanaugh, a graduate of Hampshire College, created excellent documentation of our process. That documentation can be viewed by clicking here. A subsequent group of students realized the impressive cabinetwork. Credit for these photos goes to smallhouseswoon. The house has now been occupied for two years.
