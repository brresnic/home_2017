      <h3>Quantitative User Research</h3>
      <p>
        I spent seven months as the quantitative user researcher for IBM's Analytics Platform portfolio. The details of that work aren't public. But, at a high level, my role was to determine IBM's strategy for utilizing usage metrics across a portfolio of SaaS products, and then implement that strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked with Meghan Corbett, another user researcher, to develop a comprehensive framework for IBM product teams to integrate quantitative and qualitative user research. We built off of existing frameworks including Google HEART and IBM's universal experiences. I showed Offering Managers how they could improve their work by utilizing metrics. I implemented a software instrumentation pipeline, utilizing Segment.io. I worked on personalizing user experiences through data-driven triggers.
      </p>

        During that time, I was further developing many of the ideas that I had orginally begun thinking about two years prior during an internship. Those initial thoughts, on using machine learning to improve UX, can be read <a href='assets/fingerprint.pdf'> here </a>
